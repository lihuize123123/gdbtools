Introduction
This header file is purposed to test cost time of a block of C program.

Usage
1. Include this file in your C program, like this:
#define DEBUG_FUNC_TIME
#include <time_record_mt.h>
2. Add macro in your function, like this:
int func()
{
	DEFINE_TIME_RECORD()

	...
	START_TIME_RECORD()
	...
	END_TIME_RECORD()
	...
	END_TIME_RECORD()
	...

	return 0;
}
3. Call PRINT_TIME_RECORDS in the same .c file, usually when the work thread exits.
4. Compile your program and run.
You will find a .csv file named after your source file in the same directory with your exe.
Open the .csv file, you will get the cost time and excute times of each blocks which are 
between the START_TIME_RECORD and END_TIME_RECORD.

Known limititions
1. All these include and macros should be added in the same .c file.
2. All the macros should be added in a common thread, so that calling PRINT_TIME_RECORDS 
will print the cost time that has been computed by END_TIME_RECORD macro.
3. As time record is realized usging hash table. Lines of source .c file should be less 
than 2^16, and ENT_TIME_RECORD should ben called less than 60*2 times.
